        <h4>Investing in skills for socio-economic empowerment in rural women</h4>

        <p class="para">
            
            <ul> <li>Skill development is key to improving rural productivity, employability, and income-earning opportunities, enhancing food security, and providing environmentally sustainable rural development and livelihoods.</li>
            <li>Skill development is particularly important to rural women who are more likely to be contributing family workers, subsistence farmers, or home-based micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sectors.</li>
            
            <b>Why action is needed?</b>
            <p>
            Lower work status traps women in a vicious circle with limited development perspectives. Rural women’s limited access to productive resources, lower educational levels, and social norms about appropriate work for women tend to confine them to lower paid, lower status work where opportunities for skills and advanced are reduced.
            
            What are policy options?
            <ol>
            <li>	Reduce financial barriers for rural women to access skills training.</li>
            <li>	Increasing the number of women trainers and agricultural extensions.</li>
            <li>Providing infrastructure support and facilities, childcare, service, and tool kits.</li>
            <li>	Raising awareness among rural women, and their families, communication about the benefits of training women in non-traditional trades.</li>
            <li>	Expand rural women’s access to science, mobile phones, computers, and other information.</li>

        <h4>Rural Women's Employment challenges (Problems still faced by women after getting a job)</h4>
        <p class="para">
    
            <ul>
            There can be various reasons why women in rural areas in India may not be able to work on their skills and earn money. Here are some of the main factors that contribute to this situation:</li>
            <li>Limited Access to Education: Lack of access to quality education is a significant barrier for women in rural areas. Many girls are not enrolled in schools or drop out at an early age due to factors such as poverty, cultural norms, and distance to schools. Without education, women may not develop the necessary skills for employment opportunities. </li>
            <li>Gender Inequality: Traditional gender roles and patriarchal societal norms often restrict women's mobility and decision-making power. Women may face discrimination, both within their families and in the broader community, which limits their ability to pursue careers or gain financial independence. Lack of Infrastructure: Rural areas often lack basic infrastructure like transportation, electricity, and internet connectivity. These limitations make it challenging for women to access employment opportunities, receive skill training, or engage in remote work options.</li>
             <li>Unpaid Care Responsibilities: Women in rural areas often bear the burden of unpaid care work, including household chores, childcare, and taking care of elderly family members. These responsibilities can consume their time and energy, leaving little room for skill development or paid work outside the home.
             ,<li>Limited Job Opportunities: Rural areas typically have fewer employment opportunities compared to urban areas. The available jobs may be predominantly in agriculture or informal sectors, which may not require specific skills or provide adequate financial returns.
             Stigma and Safety Concerns: Women in rural areas often face social stigma and safety concerns when venturing outside their homes for work. This can discourage them from seeking employment or pursuing skill development opportunities. </li>
            <li>Financial Resources: Limited access to financial resources, such as credit facilities or microfinance, can hinder women from starting their own businesses or investing in skill development programs. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that focuses on improving education, promoting gender equality, investing in rural infrastructure, providing childcare support, creating more job opportunities, and empowering women economically.</li>

        <h4> obstacles and ways to facilitate skill development among rural women:</h4>
        <li>
            <p class="para">
            Shri Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India has stated “Today, the world and India need a skilled workforce. If we have to promote the development of our country, then our mission has to be skill development and a skilled India. Confident, self-reliant, and develop in them the ability to be a part of decision-making at home and outside.
    Pradhan Mantra kaushal vikas yojana (PMKVY), UDAAN, standard training assessment and reward (STAR), and many more have been formulated to initiate the concept.
